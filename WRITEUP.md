### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*
##### The proposed solution would be the VM to avoid the cost and due to the fact is a very simple application that doesn't carry out high-traffic users or important data could be moved later on to the app service as per business needs and application growth. App service will be more efficient if the business needs scalability and high availability. thus, APP service would be good choice to go with   

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
